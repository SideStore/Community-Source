The iNDS Team release of iNDS is a fork of the original iNDS emulator by William Cobb. The iNDS Team aims to create a version that is driven by support from the community, adding trusted contributors to the team over time so that pull requests and issues do not sit untouched.\n\nCurrently, emulation is powered by the DeSmuME threaded ARM interpreter and runs at nearly full speed on the iPhone 5 and above. Due to the need to mmap the entire ROM into memory, older devices with only 256MB of RAM are not supported. These devices include the iPod Touch 4, iPad 1, iPhone 3GS, and anything below those devices.",

Apps in the DOS days are often simpler and surprisingly productive.\n\nKEYBOARD\n\niDOS provides a PC compatible on-screen keyboard with carefully designed layouts for different devices and orientations. The keyboard has a sliding control in landscape mode so that you can keep it from covering critical part of the screen.\n\nBluetooth keyboard is partially supported. We support ESC, function keys, and ordinary CTRL and ALT key bindings. Unfortunately the arrow keys can't be used for game control. You should use a bluetooth game controller instead.\n\nGAMEPAD\n\niDOS provides a virtual gamepad with key bindings that are fairly common in DOS games. You can customize the bindings. The DPAD works in 8-axis way. It can also be toggled into a joystick.\n\nExternal bluetooth game controllers are supported. Make sure your game controller is connected (System Settings->Bluetooth). To customize button bindings, go to iDOS in landscape mode, tap on bluetooth icon on the auto-hiding top bar.\n\nMOUSE\n\n* The screen area serves as a trackpad for moving mouse pointer.\n* Tap on the screen for left click. If direct touch is enabled, the mouse pointer will move to where you tap.\n* Hold one finger on the screen, and tap with another finger for right click.\n* On-screen mouse buttons are also provided for your convenience.\n* Bluetooth mice are only partially supported.\n\nSUPPORT\n\n- Visit https://litchie.com/dospad for more information.\n- Send email to idos@litchie.com\n- Follow the developer on Twitter: https://twitter.com/litchiedev\n- iDOS is open source, report issues on https://github.com/litchie/dospad",

The ethos of the app is to merge the technologies of today with a pixel-perfect recreation of the user experience of the past. The vast majority of apps in OldOS are fully functional \u2014 meaning they seamlessly integrate with the data on your phone to deliver a live, emulator-esque experience. What does this mean? Well, you can play your music in iPod, get directions in Maps, surf the web in Safari, view the current weather in Weather, and much more. By the same token, no shortcuts were taken in fully fleshing out the operating system. You can change your background, adjust settings, search apps, et cetera. There are a few apps still not ready for primetime but don't worry, they're coming soon.\n\nWith OldOS, you no longer need to worry about securing a legacy iPhone to experience nostalgia \u2014 it's available on your daily driver.\n\nPart of the goal with OldOS is to enable anyone to understand how iOS works and demonstrate just how powerful SwiftUI truly is. For that reason, the entire app is open-sourced \u2014 enabling developers to learn about, modify, and add to the app. I thought building this over my last six or so months in high school and sharing it with the world would be a fun and productive endeavor.\n\nSpecial Features:\n* \ud83e\uddd1\u200d\ud83d\udcbb Built almost entirely using SwiftUI.\n* \ud83c\udfa8 Designed to be as close to pixel-perfect as possible.\n* \ud83d\udcf1 Fully functional, perhaps even usable as a second OS.\n* \u2764\ufe0f A testament to the work of Apple employees of both the past and the present.\n* \ud83d\uddfa\ufe0f Fully open source for all to learn, modify, and build on.",
